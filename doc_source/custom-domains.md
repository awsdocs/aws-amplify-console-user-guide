# Set up custom domains<a name="custom-domains"></a>

You can connect a custom domain to an app that you’ve deployed with Amplify Hosting\. You can purchase a custom domain through a domain registrar such as Amazon Route 53, GoDaddy, or Google Domains\. Route 53 is Amazon’s Domain Name System \(DNS\) web service\. For more information about using Route 53, see [What is Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html)\.

When you use Amplify to deploy your web app, Amplify hosts it on a URL like the following example:

```
https://branch-name.d1m7bkiki6tdw1.amplifyapp.com
```

When you connect a custom domain, users see that your app is hosted on a custom URL, such as the following:

```
https://www.example.com
```

Amplify issues an SSL/TLS certificate for all domains connected to your app so that all traffic is secured through HTTPS/2\. The certificate generated by AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\) is valid for 13 months and renews automatically as long as your app is hosted with Amplify\. Note that Amplify can't renew the certificate if the CNAME verification record has been modified or deleted in the DNS settings with your domain provider\. You must delete and add the domain again in the Amplify console\.

**Custom domain prerequisites**
+ Purchase a custom domain through a domain registrar\. The set up procedures in this guide require you to use information from the Amplify console to manually update your DNS settings on your domain registrar's website\.
+ Prior to connecting an app to a custom domain, the app must be deployed in Amplify\. For more information about completing this step, see [Getting started with existing code](getting-started.md)\.
+ Connecting your app to a custom domain requires a basic knowledge of domains and DNS terminology\. For more information about domains and DNS, see [Understanding DNS terminology and concepts](understanding-dns-terminology-and-concepts.md)\.
