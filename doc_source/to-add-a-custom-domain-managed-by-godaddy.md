# Add a custom domain managed by GoDaddy<a name="to-add-a-custom-domain-managed-by-godaddy"></a>

**To add a custom domain managed by GoDaddy**

1. Follow steps one through six of the procedure [Add a custom domain managed by a third\-party DNS provider](to-add-a-custom-domain-managed-by-a-third-party-dns-provider.md)\.

1. Log in to your GoDaddy account\.

1. In your list of domains, find the domain to add and choose **DNS**\. GoDaddy displays a list of records for your domain\. You need to add two new CNAME records\.

1. Create the first CNAME record to point your subdomains to the Amplify domain\.

   1. For **Host**, enter only the subdomain\. For example, if your subdomain is **www\.example\.com**, enter **www** for **Host**\.

   1. For **Points to**, look at your DNS records in the Amplify console and then enter the value\. If the Amplify console displays the domain for your app as **xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\.cloudfront\.net**, enter **xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\.cloudfront\.net** for **Points to**\.

1. Create the second CNAME record to point to the AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\) validation server\. A single validated ACM generates an SSL/TLS certificate for your domain\.

   1. For **Host**, enter the subdomain\.

      For example, if the DNS record in the Amplify console for verifying ownership of your subdomain is **\_c3e2d7eaf1e656b73f46cd6980fdc0e\.example\.com**, enter only **\_c3e2d7eaf1e656b73f46cd6980fdc0e** for **Host**\.

   1. For **Points to**, enter the ACM validation certificate\.

       For example, if the validation server is **\_cjhwou20vhu2exampleuw20vuyb2ovb9\.j9s73ucn9vy\.acm\-validations\.aws **, enter **\_cjhwou20vhu2exampleuw20vuyb2ovb9\.j9s73ucn9vy\.acm\-validations\.aws** for **Points to**\.

**Note**  
The certificate generated by AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\) is valid for 13 months and renews automatically as long as your app is hosted with Amplify\. Amplify can't renew the certificate if the CNAME verification record has been modified or deleted\. You must delete and add the domain again in the Amplify console\.

1. This step is not required for subdomains\. GoDaddy doesn’t support ANAME/ALIAS records\. For DNS providers that do not have ANAME/ALIAS support, we strongly recommend migrating your DNS to Amazon Route 53\. For more information, see [Configuring Amazon Route 53 as your DNS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-configuring.html)\.

   If you want to keep GoDaddy as your provider and update the root domain, add **Forwarding** and set up a domain forward:

   1. Scroll down to the bottom of the **DNS Management** page to find the **Forwarding** box\.

   1. For **Forward to**, choose **http://**, and then enter the name of your subdomain to foward to \(for example, **www\.example\.com**\)\.

   1. For **Forward Type**, choose **Temporary \(302\)**\. 

   1. For **Settings**, choose **Forward only**\.
