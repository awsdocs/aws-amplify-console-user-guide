# Manage subdomains<a name="to-manage-subdomains"></a>

A subdomain is the part of your URL that appears before your domain name\. For example, **www** is the subdomain of **www\.amazon\.com** and **aws** is the subdomain of **aws\.amazon\.com**\. If you already have a production website, you might want to only connect a subdomain\. Subdomains can also be multilevel, for example **beta\.alpha\.example\.com** has the multilevel subdomain **beta\.alpha**\.
