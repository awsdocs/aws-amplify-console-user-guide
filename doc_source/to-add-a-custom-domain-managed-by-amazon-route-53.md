**To add a custom domain managed by Route 53**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/)\.

1. Choose your app that you want to connect to a custom domain\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **App Settings**, **Domain management**\.

1. On the **Domain management** page, choose **Add domain**\.

1. For **Domain**, enter your root domain, choose the domain you want to use when it appears in the list, and then choose **Configure Domain**\.

   As you start typing, any root domains that you already manage in Route 53 appear in the list\. For example, if the name of your domain is **https://example\.com**, enter **example\.com** for **Domain**\.

1. By default, Amplify automatically creates two subdomain entries for your domain\. For example, if your domain name is **example\.com**, you will see the subdomains **https://www\.example\.com** and **https://example\.com** with a redirect set up from the root domain to the **www** subdomain\.

   \(Optional\) You can modify the default configuration if you want to add subdomains only\. To change the default configuration, choose **Rewrites and redirects** from the navigation pane, configure your domain, and then choose **Save**\.

**Note**  
 It can take up to 24 hours for the DNS to propagate and to issue the certificate\. For help with resolving errors that occur, see [Troubleshooting custom domains](custom-domain-troubleshoot-guide.md)\.
