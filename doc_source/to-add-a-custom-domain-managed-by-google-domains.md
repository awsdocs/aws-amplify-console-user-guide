**To add a custom domain managed by Google Domains**

1. Follow steps one through seven of the procedure [To add a custom domain managed by a third\-party DNS provider](to-add-a-custom-domain-managed-by-a-third-party-dns-provider.md)\.

1. Log in to your account at [https://domains\.google\.com](https://domains.google.com) and choose **My domains** in the left navigation pane\.

1. In your list of domains, find the domain to add and choose **Manage**\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **DNS**\. Google displays the **Resource records** for your domain\. You need to add two new CNAME records\.

1. Create the first CNAME record to point all subdomains to the Amplify domain as follows:

   1. For **Host name**, enter only the subdomain name\. For example, if your subdomain is **www\.example\.com**, enter **www** for **Host name**\.

   1. For **Type**, choose **CNAME**\.

   1. For **Data**, enter the value that's available in the Amplify console\. 

      If the Amplify console displays the domain for your app as **d111111abcdef8\.cloudfront\.net**, enter **d111111abcdef8\.cloudfront\.net** for **Data**\.

1. Create the second CNAME record to point to the AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\) validation server\. A single validated ACM generates an SSL/TLS certificate for your domain\. 

   1. For **Host name**, enter the subdomain\.

      For example, if the DNS record in the Amplify console for verifying ownership of your subdomain is **\_c3e2d7eaf1e656b73f46cd6980fdc0e\.example\.com**, enter only **\_c3e2d7eaf1e656b73f46cd6980fdc0e** for **Host name**\. 

   1. For **Type**, choose **CNAME**\.

   1. For **Data**, enter the ACM validation certificate\.

      For example, if the validation server is **\_cf1z2npwt9vzexample93c1j4xzc92wl\.2te3iym6kzr\.acm\-validations\.aws\.**, enter **\_cf1z2npwt9vzexample93c1j4xzc92wl\.2te3iym6kzr\.acm\-validations\.aws\.** for **Data**\. 
**Note**  
The certificate generated by AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\) is valid for 13 months and renews automatically as long as your app is hosted with Amplify\. Amplify can't renew the certificate if the CNAME verification record has been modified or deleted\. You must delete and add the domain again in the Amplify console\.

1. Google Domains doesn’t support ANAME/ALIAS records\. For DNS providers that don't have ANAME/ALIAS support, we strongly recommend migrating your DNS to Amazon Route 53\. For more information, see [Configuring Amazon Route 53 as your DNS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-configuring.html)\. If you want to keep Google Domains as your provider and update the root domain, set up a subdomain forward\. Locate the **Website** page for your Google domain\. Then choose **Forward domain** and configure your forwarding on the **Web forwarding** page\.

**Note**  
 Updates to your DNS settings for a Google domain can take up to 48 hours to take effect\. For help with resolving errors that occur, see [Troubleshooting custom domains](custom-domain-troubleshoot-guide.md)\.
